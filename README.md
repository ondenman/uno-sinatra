# Uno! Use Sinatra to Implement a REST API

Following this tutorial: https://www.sitepoint.com/uno-use-sinatra-implement-rest-api/

> In this article, we’ll look at a server-side implementation of REST using Sinatra. We’ll also look at a simple client-side REST application to validate the Sinatra server implementation. We’ll demonstrate using a simple card game, where a single deck of cards will be held by the server and dealt out to four clients. In the end, we’ll see how simple it is to create applications that run across clients and servers, using REST to help shuttle data back and forth.
